Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a geographer, GIS analyst, and data nerd living in Portland, Oregon.  I’m exploring the world of GIS development, data analysis, and web mapping through *mostly* an open-source lens. I’d like to share my experiences and lessons to those interested.

### Experience ###

I've been in the geospatial field for about 5 years, mostly as a researcher in the environmental and natural sciences. I've been fortunate enough to take part in many cool research efforts, such as bathymetric lake mapping, modeling the impact of biofuel production on land-use, and mapping wetlands and forests. Lately, I've been developing python tools to help scientists solve environmental and water-related spatial problems.

### Education ###
Master's of Geography, University of Kansas  
BS Environmental Studies, University of Kansas

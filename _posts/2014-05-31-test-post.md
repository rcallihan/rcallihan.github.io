###The why###

I'm exploring the world of GIS development, data analysis, and web mapping through mostly an open-source lens. In an attempt to pay it forward, I'd like to share my experiences and lessons those interested.   

###Potential topics###

While keeping to a concise topic is ideal, it's rare these days, for me at least, to follow any one blog/site because of a particular theme. Instead, we stumble (or tumble) on onto blog/help sites because of a particular issue or topic we've been googling. With this in mind, I will try to stay on topic, but will have no qualms writing about some esoteric subject I think may help some desperate googling soul out there. Mainly, topics will include: **GIS, spatial analysis, open source web mapping, remote sensing/image processing, and environmental science.**     

###The site###

The site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using a slightly deviated version of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. For anyone curious about Jekyll, in my experience so far, it's very easy to setup, customize, and create content. It seems like a good middle ground for anyone who knows a few things about the web but would rather spend their time creating content than developing a site.

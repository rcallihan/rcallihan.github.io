An approach on mapping activity from the Moves app

###Why I use the Moves app###

Why? After moving to a new city (Portland, Or) and spending a considerable effort exploring the seemingly endless venues/coffee shops/restraunts/bars/parks, I realized I didn't have a good record of where I've been. On top of that, I'm biking, walking, and running like never before, so why not track that too? Simply, I wanted a way to easily both log the places I've been and how I got there. I'm an android user and after testing several far-too-feature-packed options, I settled on Moves. 

####Perks of the Moves app####
* Simple and fanastic UI
* It uses the Foursquare API to easily log your place
* Detects the type of your movement (ie biking, running, walking) 
* And finally, it now has a native tool to [export](https://accounts.moves-app.com/signin/export) your data in several formats (JSON, CSV, KML, GPX and ICS)

Basically, Moves is a great location tracking app disguised as a fitness tracker.

**Disclaimer:** In April, [Facebook bought the Moves app](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/facebook-acquires-activity-tracking-app-moves/). Moves [does share your data with Facebook](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/6/5688334/moves-app-will-share-user-data-with-facebook), so that's something to consider. If you're an Android user, Google [does this already](http://www.babble.com/tech/creepy-cool-google-location-history-mapping-your-every-move/).

###Mapbox & Tilemill###

The combination of Tilemill and Mapbox is one of the easiest ways to style and display your spatial data on the web. Coincidently, [Garret Miller](https://twitter.com/heyitsgarrett) at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) made a [really nice tutorial](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapping-moves/) on how to export your Moves data, style it in [Tilemill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) and add a basemap through [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) and publish your map online. I've chosen the Tilemill/Mapbox method mostly because I love Mapbox but also because they provide a really handy [GPX to GeoJSON tool.](https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson)

###Adding a Legend in TileMill###
A map of this nature is pretty useless without a legend. Using some direction from TileMill, I made this simple legend for my Moves data. To recreate this legend, copy and paste the html and css code below into the Legends tab of the Templates panel in TileMill. 

The legend doesn't show in an iframe insertion like the map above, but it will show from the version hosted on mapbox. [Click here for my map](https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/rcallihan.iedo4jhh/page.html#13/45.5243/-122.6954)

###Next posts###

I really haven't done much here that wasn't already described in Garret Miller's [post](https://twitter.com/heyitsgarrett), but in the next couple of posts I plan to accomplish a few extra things:

* Map place locations
* Show some strategies for cleaning up the Moves Polyline data
